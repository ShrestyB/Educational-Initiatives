# Legacy Student Database Integration with Adapter Pattern

## Overview

This project demonstrates the **Adapter Design Pattern** to integrate a legacy student database system into a modern educational platform. The Adapter Pattern helps bridge the gap between the old API of the legacy system and the new API expected by the current system, allowing seamless communication.

## Features

- **Adapter Pattern**: Adapts the legacy student database's interface to the modern system.
- **Seamless Integration**: Allows the modern system to interact with the old API without changing the legacy system's code.
- **Modular Design**: Isolates the old and new systems, making future modifications or replacements of the legacy system easier.

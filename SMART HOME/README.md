# Smart Home System

## Overview

This project implements a **Smart Home System** that allows users to control smart devices such as lights, thermostats, and door locks via a central hub. It incorporates design patterns such as **Observer**, **Factory Method**, and **Proxy** to provide a flexible, scalable, and well-structured system. Users can perform actions such as turning devices on/off, scheduling operations, and automating tasks based on triggers.

## Features

- **Device Control**: Manage devices like lights, thermostats, and door locks (turn on/off, adjust settings).
- **Scheduling**: Schedule tasks like turning devices on or off at a particular time.
- **Automation**: Create triggers to automate tasks (e.g., turn off lights when the thermostat reaches a certain temperature).
- **Dynamic Device Management**: Add or remove devices dynamically.
- **Design Patterns Used**:
  - **Observer Pattern**: Update all devices when thereâ€™s a change in the system.
  - **Factory Method Pattern**: Simplify the creation of different smart device instances.
  - **Proxy Pattern**: Control access to the smart devices.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Initialize the Smart Home System** with devices such as lights, thermostats, and door locks, each with a unique ID.
2. **Turn devices on/off** through the central hub.
3. **Schedule devices** to turn on or off at specified times.
4. **Automate actions** based on triggers (e.g., temperature changes).
5. **View device status**: Check the current state of all devices in the home.
6. **Add/remove devices** dynamically.

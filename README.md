Brief Overview of Tasks
Each task is accompanied by a detailed README.md file located in its respective directory. These files provide comprehensive information, including objectives, implementation details. They are designed to guide users through understanding and utilizing each task effectively.

Smart Home System
The Smart Home System is a Java application designed to create a simulated smart home environment.It enables users to manage a variety of smart devices, including lights, thermostats, and door locks, through a centralized hub. Users can configure schedules, automate actions, monitor device status and reports, and manage triggers for enhanced control.

Patterns Overview
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices and can be used to improve code readability and reusability.

Use Cases
1. Observer Pattern
Use Case: Notification System for Assignment Deadlines
Description: This pattern allows multiple subscribers to listen and react to events (e.g., assignment deadlines).

2. Strategy Pattern
Use Case: Grading System with Different Evaluation Strategies
Description: This pattern enables the selection of an evaluation strategy at runtime, allowing flexible grading methods.

3. Singleton Pattern
Use Case: Global Configurations for Online Learning Platform
Description: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

4. Factory Pattern
Use Case: Quiz Question Factory
Description: This pattern provides an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

5. Adapter Pattern
Use Case: Legacy Student Database Integration
Description: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together, enabling integration with legacy systems.

6. Decorator Pattern
Use Case: User Role-Based Access Control
Description: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically, allowing for flexible access control based on user roles

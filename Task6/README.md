# User Role-Based Access Control with Decorator Pattern

## Overview

This project demonstrates the **Decorator Design Pattern** by implementing a role-based access control system for an educational platform. Depending on the role (Admin, Teacher, or Student), different permissions are dynamically added to the user object without modifying the base user class. This pattern allows adding responsibilities like creating assignments, grading assignments, or submitting assignments based on the user's role.

## Features

- **Decorator Pattern**: Dynamically adds role-based permissions to users without altering their core structure.
- **User Role System**: Supports different user roles (Admin, Teacher, Student) with varying levels of access.
- **Flexible Design**: Easily extendable to include new roles and permissions without modifying the existing codebase.

# Quiz Question Factory

## Overview

This project implements a Factory Pattern to generate different types of quiz questions for an online learning platform. The factory allows for the dynamic creation of question objects (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, short answer) based on the course module requirements.

## Features

- **Factory Pattern**: Simplifies the creation of different types of quiz questions.
- **Dynamic Question Generation**: Instantiate question types at runtime based on input parameters.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Decouples the question creation logic from the main application logic.
